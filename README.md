This is a project to put in practice how to consume api, in this project I  put in practice HTML,CSS,JS,Axios   also Bootstrap was use for a faster way to web responsibe. 
mainly this project was inspired by me, you could find proties for sale any where in the USA just by filling up a form  just input citie and state, min bedroom  size and  min bathroom size and click search button.
